    <p>The Borneo elephant, also called the Bornean elephant or the Borneo pygmy elephant, is a subspecies of Asian
        elephant that inhabits northeastern Borneo, in Indonesia and Malaysia. Its origin remains the
        subject of debate. A definitive subspecific classification as Elephas maximus borneensis awaits a detailed
        range-wide morphometric and genetic study. In 2024, the Borneo elephant has been listed as Endangered on the
        IUCN Red List as the population has declined by at least 50% over the last three generations, estimated to be
        60-75 years. It is pre-eminently threatened by loss, degradation and fragmentation of habitat.
